# Autonomous-Drive-NeuralNet Project

## Overview
This project aims to develop a neural network capable of real-time steering angle prediction for autonomous driving. It utilizes a convolutional neural network (CNN) inspired by NVIDIA's work in self-driving cars, integrating IoT for data acquisition and deep learning for decision-making.

## Features
- Real-time steering angle prediction.
- Integration with IoT devices for data capture.
- Use of advanced CNN for image processing.

## Installation
To set up the project environment:
1. Clone the repository: `git clone [repository URL]`.
2. Install required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Usage
- Run the main script to start training the model: `python main.py` (replace `main.py` with your script's name).
- The script will process the input data and train the model for steering angle prediction.

## Documentation
For detailed information about the project's architecture, setup, and usage, refer to the [Project Documentation](./docs/DOCUMENTATION.md).
