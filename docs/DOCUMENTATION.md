# Autonomous-Drive-NeuralNet Project Documentation

## Project Overview

The Autonomous-Drive-NeuralNet project aims to develop a convolutional neural network (CNN) capable of real-time steering angle prediction for self-driving cars. The project integrates IoT for data acquisition and leverages deep learning for image processing and decision-making, mimicking human driving behavior.

## Architecture

- **Neural Network Architecture**: The project uses a CNN model inspired by the NVIDIA model used for their self-driving cars. The CNN takes images from the car's perspective as input and outputs steering angles.
- **Data Flow**: Images captured by the car's camera are fed into the model, which then processes these images to predict steering angles, enabling the car to navigate autonomously.

## Setup Instructions

- **Dependencies**: Ensure Python 3 and necessary libraries (like TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV) are installed. Refer to `requirements.txt` for a detailed list of libraries.
- **Environment Setup**: Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install required packages.
- **Data Preparation**: Download the dataset as per instructions in the `data/` directory's README.

## Usage

- **Running the Script**: Use `python main.py` (replace `main.py` with the primary script name) to start the training process.
- **Training the Model**: The script will train the CNN model on the provided dataset.
- **Evaluation**: After training, evaluate the model's performance on a separate test set.
